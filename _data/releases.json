    "body": "## Dependency Upgrades\n- [Squirrel.Mac](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Mac), Electron's bundled\n  macOS auto updater library, was upgraded to 0.3.0 which includes several bug\n  fixes. The new version enables [App Transport Security (ATS)](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW35)\n  on all requests it makes to the update server. This can be disabled,\n  if needed, by adding `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads` to the app's plist file. <a href=\"https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7933\">#7933</a>\n\n## New APIs\n- You can now enable the macOS vibrancy effect on a `BrowserWindow` by calling\n  `setVibrancy(vibrancyType)` or by including a `vibrancy` value in the\n  constructor options. <a href=\"https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7898\">#7898</a>\n- You can now specify `POST` data when calling `BrowserWindow.loadURL` via the\n  `postData` option. Also `<form>` tags configured with `method=post` will now\n  make `POST` requests with their data when submitted. <a href=\"https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7540\">#7540</a>\n- The certificate specified to the `session.setCertificateVerifyProc` callback\n  now includes the entire certificate chain. <a href=\"https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7917\">#7917</a>\n- The `<webview>` tag now supports a `disableguestresize` attribute that will\n  disable automatic resizing of the guest `webContents` when the `<webview>`\n  element resizes. You can now call `setSize` directly on the guest\n  `webContents` to manually control the size. <a href=\"https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7658\">#7658</a>\n- The `chrome.storage.remove` and `chrome.storage.clear` APIs are now available\n  to DevTools extensions. <a href=\"https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7923\">#7923</a>\n\n## Bug Fixes\n- The `about:` protocol is now correctly supported by default. <a href=\"https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7908\">#7908</a>\n- Menu item keyboard accelerators are now properly disabled when the menu item\n  is disabled. <a href=\"https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7962\">#7962</a>\n- The check for disabling ASAR support via the `ELECTRON_NO_ASAR` environment\n  variable is now cached for better performance. <a href=\"https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7978\">#7978</a>\n- Fixed a crash when calling `app.setAboutPanelOptions(options)` with a\n  `credits` value. <a href=\"https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7979\">#7979</a>\n- Fixed an issue where an error would be thrown in certain cases when accessing\n  remote objects or functions. <a href=\"https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7980\">#7980</a>\n- Fixed an issue where the `window.opener` API did not behave as expected.\n",
