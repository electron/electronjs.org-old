At [OpenJS World](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/nodejs-interactive-2019/) this morning, we announced that Electron has officially graduated from the [OpenJS Foundation's](https://openjsf.org/) incubation program, and is now an OpenJS Foundation Impact Project. 

Electron [entered incubation in December of 2019](https://openjsf.org/blog/2019/12/11/electron-joins-the-openjs-foundation/), at the last OpenJS Foundation global conference in Montreal. We're excited to take a larger role in the JavaScript community as an Impact Project, and continue our partnership with the OpenJS Foundation. This is an exciting move for Electron, and we see it as a next step in our evolution as an open-source project.

## Learning more

You can read up on the foundation, its mission, and its members on the [OpenJSF website](https://www.notion.so/Electron-joins-the-OpenJS-Foundation-d898f12480874e56abe78f29b041fb91#0801fd7e9fa340afbcdce0510ba05f8a). The OpenJS Foundation is host to a number of open source JavaScript projects including jQuery, Node.js, and webpack. It's supported by 30 corporate and end-user members, including GoDaddy, Google, IBM, Intel, Joyent, and Microsoft.

Electron is an open–source framework for building cross-platform desktop applications with web technologies. To learn more about the humans behind Electron and how they work together, take a look at our [Governance page](https://electronjs.org/governance).
