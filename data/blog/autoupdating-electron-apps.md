title: Easier AutoUpdating for Open-Source Apps

Today we're releasing a free, open-source, hosted 
[updates webservice][update.electronjs.org] and companion 
[npm package][update-electron-app]
to enable easy automatic updates for open-source Electron apps. This is a step 
toward empowering app developers to think less about
deployment and more about developing high-quality experiences for their users.

## Making life easier

Electron has an [autoUpdater] API that gives apps the ability to
consume metadata from a remote endpoint to check for updates, download them 
in the background, and install them automatically.

Enabling these updates has been a cumbersome step in the deployment process 
for many Electron app developers because it requires a web server to be deployed 
and maintained just to serve app version history metadata.

Today we are announcing a new drop-in solution for automatic app updates.
If your Electron app is in a public GitHub repository and you're using 
GitHub Releases to publish builds, you can use this service to deliver 
continuous app updates to your users.

## Using the new module

To minimize configuration on your part, we've created [update-electron-app], 
an npm module which integrates with the new [update.electronjs.org] webservice.

Install the module:

```sh
npm install update-electron-app
```

Call it from anywhere in your app's [main process]:

```js
require('update-electron-app')()
```

That's it! The module will check for updates at app startup, then 
every ten minutes. When an update is found it will download automically
in the background, and a dialog will be displayed when the update is ready.

## Migrating existing apps

Apps already using Electron's autoUpdater API can use this service too. 
To do so, you can 
[customize the `update-electron-app`][update-electron-app] module
or 
[integrate directly with update.electronjs.org][update.electronjs.org].

## Alternatives

If you're using [electron-builder] to package your app, you can use its 
built-in updater. For details, see 
[electron.build/auto-update](https://www.electron.build/auto-update).

If your app is private, you may need to run your own update server. There are 
a number of open-source tools for this, including Zeit's [Hazel] and
Atlassian's [Nucleus]. See the [Deploying an Update Server] tutorial for more 
info.

## Thanks

Thanks to [Julian Gruber] for helping design and build this simple and scalable 
web service. Thanks to the folks at [Zeit] for their open-source [Hazel] 
service, from which we drew design inspiration. Thanks to [Samuel Attard] for 
the code reviews. Thanks to the Electron community for helping test this 
service.

🌲 Here's to an evergreen future for Electron apps!
