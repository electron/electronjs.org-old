      Electron Fiddle lets you create and play with small Electron experiments.
      It greets you with a quick-start template after opening – change a few things, choose
      the version of Electron you want to run it with, and play around. Then, save your
      Fiddle either as a GitHub Gist or to a local folder. Once pushed to GitHub,
      anyone can quickly try your Fiddle out by just entering it in the address bar.
    explore: Explore Electron
    explore_desc:
      "Try Electron without installing any dependencies: Fiddle includes everything
      you'll need to explore the platform. It also includes examples for every API
      available in Electron, so if you want to quickly see what a BrowserView is or
      how the desktopCapturer works, Fiddle has got you covered."
    code_with_types: Code with Types
    code_with_types_desc:
      Fiddle includes Microsoft's excellent Monaco Editor, the same editor
      powering Visual Studio Code. It also installs the type definitions
      for the currently selected version of Electron automatically,
      ensuring that you always have all Electron APIs only a few
      keystrokes away.
    compile_and_package: Compile and Package
    compile_and_package_desc:
      Fiddle can automatically turn your experiment into binaries you can
      share with your friends, coworkers, or grandparents. It does so thanks
      to <a href="https://electronforge.io/">electron-forge</a>, allowing you to package your fiddle as an app for
      Windows, macOS, or Linux.
    easy_start: Start with Fiddle, Continue Wherever
    easy_start_desc:
      Fiddle is not an IDE – it is however an excellent starting point.
      Once your fiddle has grown up, export it as a project with or
      without <a href="https://electronforge.io/">electron-forge</a>.
      Then, use your favorite editor and take on the world!
